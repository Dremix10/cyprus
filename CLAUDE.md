# Cyprus — Tichu Card Game

Online multiplayer Tichu card game with bot opponents.

## Stack

- **Monorepo** with npm workspaces: `packages/client`, `packages/server`, `packages/shared`
- **Client**: React + Vite + Zustand (TypeScript)
- **Server**: Express + Socket.IO + better-sqlite3 (TypeScript, ESM)
- **Shared**: TypeScript types for socket events, game state, room state

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev mode (server + client concurrently)
npm run build        # Build all workspaces (shared, client, server)
npm start            # Production: node packages/server/dist/index.js
npm run lint         # ESLint across all packages
npm run test         # Vitest (if tests present)
npm run clean        # Remove all dist/ folders
```

## Git Workflow

- **`main`** — production branch. Pushes auto-deploy to the live server. Only merge here when ready to ship.
- **`dev`** — development branch. Push freely, no deploy triggered. All feature work and bug fixes go here first.
- **Workflow**: branch from `dev` or commit to `dev` → test → merge `dev` into `main` when ready to deploy.
- **Claude Code**: Always work on `dev` branch unless explicitly told to deploy to production. Check current branch with `git branch` before making changes. If on `main`, switch to `dev` first.
- **NEVER push directly to `main`** during active game sessions — deploys restart the server and disconnect all players.

## Deployment

- **Auto-deploy**: pushes to `main` trigger GitHub Actions → SSH → pull + build + restart
- **Server**: Digital Ocean droplet at `165.245.175.45`
- **User**: `dev` (no sudo — need root for process management)
- **Nginx** proxies port 80 -> localhost:3001
- **Deploy**: `sudo bash deploy/killstart.sh` (kills old server, starts new one)
- **Full deploy** (pull + build + restart): `sudo bash deploy/restart.sh`
- **Rebuild only**: `bash deploy/rebuild.sh`
- **Logs**: `tail -f server.log`
- **Health**: `curl localhost:3001/health` — returns commit hash, message, date, uptime, and active connections. Use to verify deploys without SSH
- **Admin dashboard**: http://165.245.175.45/admin (password-protected)

## Architecture

### Server (`packages/server/src/`)
- `index.ts` — Express app, Socket.IO setup, helmet security headers, HTTP request logging, admin routes, graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT), uncaught error handlers
- `SocketHandler.ts` — All socket event handlers, rate limiting (per-socket + per-IP), DB event logging, bot action scheduling, turn timers (60s), disconnect→bot replacement (2min), session reconnect, room persistence (debounced to disk every 5s)
- `RoomManager.ts` — Room CRUD, player join/reconnect, session-based auth (UUID v4), nickname validation, seat management, room serialization/restore for crash recovery
- `GameEngine.ts` — Tichu game logic, all phases (Grand Tichu → Passing → Playing → Scoring), card combinations, wish enforcement, serialize/restore for persistence
- `BotAI.ts` — Bot AI (easy/medium/hard), Greek-themed bot profiles with avatars
- `Database.ts` — SQLite tracker (better-sqlite3): connections, players, games, events, HTTP requests
- `AdminDashboard.ts` — `/admin` routes with password auth (SHA-256, timing-safe compare)

### Client (`packages/client/src/`)
- `stores/roomStore.ts` — Zustand store for room/connection state, session-based auto-reconnect (localStorage)
- `stores/gameStore.ts` — Zustand store for game state
- `components/GameBoard.tsx` — Main game UI, trick display, player areas
- `components/PlayerHand.tsx` — Card hand display with received-card indicators
- `hooks/useSocketEvents.ts` — Socket.IO event listeners

### Shared (`packages/shared/src/types/`)
- `events.ts` — Socket event type definitions (ClientToServerEvents, ServerToClientEvents)
- `game.ts` — Game state types, card types, combination types
- `player.ts` — Player position, player state types

## Session & Reconnect Flow

Players get a `sessionId` (UUID v4) on create/join, stored in localStorage. On page refresh or server restart, the client emits `session:reconnect` with the stored sessionId. The server maps sessionId → room/position and restores the player. If a player disconnects for >2 minutes during a game, they are replaced by a bot and the session is invalidated.

## Authentication

- **AuthService** (`AuthService.ts`): scrypt password hashing (N=16384, r=8, p=1), account lockout, session management
- **AuthRoutes** (`AuthRoutes.ts`): REST endpoints at `/auth/*` with HttpOnly cookie sessions
- **Endpoints**: POST `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/change-password`, `/auth/delete-account`, `/auth/google`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`; GET `/auth/me`, `/auth/google-client-id`
- **Google Sign-In**: server verifies ID token via `google-auth-library`, auto-creates/links accounts by email
- **Forgot password**: generates hashed reset token (SHA-256), sends email via nodemailer, token valid 1 hour
- **Client**: `authStore.ts` (Zustand), `AuthForms.tsx` (login/register/forgot/reset/Google), `UserBadge` component
- **Guest play**: preserved — auth is optional, guests play without accounts
- **Socket auth**: middleware reads auth cookie from handshake, attaches `socket.data.userId`/`socket.data.displayName`
- **DB tables**: `users` (id, username, display_name, password_hash, email, google_id, lockout fields), `user_sessions`, `password_reset_tokens`
- **Env vars for auth features**:
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — Google OAuth client ID (from Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID for Web)
  - `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` — SMTP credentials for password reset emails
  - `SMTP_FROM` — sender email address (defaults to SMTP_USER)
  - `APP_URL` — base URL for reset links (defaults to `http://165.245.175.45`)

## Security

- **Helmet** security headers (CSP, etc.) on all HTTP responses
- **Rate limiting**: per-socket (20 actions/5s), per-IP connections (20/min), room create/join (5/30s), session reconnect (5/30s), auth (5/min per IP)
- **Nickname validation**: 1-20 chars, alphanumeric + spaces/dashes/accented chars only
- **Password hashing**: scrypt with 32-byte random salt, timing-safe comparison
- **Account lockout**: 5 failed logins → 15 min cooldown
- **Session security**: HttpOnly + SameSite cookies, 7-day expiry, max 10 per user, cleanup on interval
- **Admin auth**: SHA-256 password hash with timing-safe comparison
- **Trust proxy**: enabled for nginx X-Forwarded-For headers
- **Graceful shutdown**: cleans up timers, persists rooms, closes DB

## Data Access (Production Database)

The server tracks connections, players, games, events, and HTTP requests in SQLite. You can query this data remotely via the admin API.

**API key**: `b295880c4d8b6118079c13457cc96ac0972396923894262b`

**Query any data** (read-only SELECT queries only):
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://165.245.175.45/admin/api/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer b295880c4d8b6118079c13457cc96ac0972396923894262b" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY games_won DESC", "limit": 100}'
```

**List tables and row counts**:
```bash
curl -s http://165.245.175.45/admin/api/tables \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer b295880c4d8b6118079c13457cc96ac0972396923894262b"
```

**Available tables**: `connections`, `players`, `games`, `game_players`, `game_events`, `http_requests`, `admin_sessions`

**Other endpoints** (all require same Bearer token):
- `GET /admin/api/stats` — summary stats
- `GET /admin/api/connections?limit=50` — recent connections
- `GET /admin/api/players?limit=100` — player leaderboard
- `GET /admin/api/games?limit=50` — recent games
- `GET /admin/api/events?limit=100` — game events
- `GET /admin/api/requests?limit=100` — HTTP request log
- `GET /admin/api/traffic?hours=24` — hourly traffic
- `GET /admin/api/top-ips?limit=20` — top IPs

## Collaborators

- **Dremix10** (GitHub) — co-developer, pushes game features (bot AI, UI, tutorials)

## Known Issues

- Bot phase race condition: bots occasionally try Grand Tichu decision after phase moved to PASSING (non-blocking error in logs)
